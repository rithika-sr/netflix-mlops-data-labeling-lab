    "# 🎬 Netflix Data Labeling Lab — Notebook 1: Weak Labeling\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 **Objective**\n",
    "This lab focuses on the **data labeling** phase of the Netflix dataset workflow.  \n",
    "The goal is to automatically generate **weak supervision labels** for one classification task — identifying whether a title is **family-friendly** — using heuristic **Labeling Functions (LFs)** instead of manual annotation.  \n",
    "The labeled dataset created here will later be used for **data augmentation**, **data slicing**, and **model development** in subsequent notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🗂 **Dataset Overview**\n",
    "The dataset `netflix_titles.csv` contains information about all movies and TV shows available on Netflix.  \n",
    "Key columns include:\n",
    "- **`type`** – Movie or TV Show  \n",
    "- **`title`** – Title of the content  \n",
    "- **`rating`** – Official content rating (G, PG-13, TV-MA, etc.)  \n",
    "- **`listed_in`** – Genres or categories  \n",
    "- **`description`** – Short synopsis  \n",
    "- **`duration`** – Runtime (e.g., “90 min”, “3 Seasons”)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ **Notebook Workflow**\n",
    "1. **Load and Inspect Data** – Import the dataset and preview its structure.  \n",
    "2. **Basic Cleaning** – Standardize column names, parse durations, and create lowercase fields for rule-based matching.  \n",
    "3. **Define Label Task** – Choose the target variable `is_family_friendly` with labels { 1 = family-friendly, 0 = not family, –1 = abstain }.  \n",
    "4. **Design Labeling Functions (LFs)** – Write heuristic rules using ratings, genres, and keywords to assign weak labels.  \n",
    "5. **Apply LFs** – Evaluate all LFs across the dataset to create a label matrix.  \n",
    "6. **Coverage & Conflict Analysis** – Measure how many rows were labeled and how often rules conflict.  \n",
    "7. **Majority Vote Aggregation** – Combine multiple LF votes into a single weak label.  \n",
    "8. **Fallback Rule** – Assign a default label where all LFs abstain.  \n",
    "9. **Inspect Examples** – Manually review sample outputs for quality control.  \n",
    "10. **Save Labeled Dataset** – Export the final weakly labeled data for future steps.  \n",
    "11. ** Evaluate LF Performance – Compare how often each rule fires and its vote distribution.  \n",
    "12. ** Export Compact Version – Save a lightweight subset for model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧩 **Key Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🪄 Labeling Functions (LFs)\n",
    "LFs are simple, interpretable heuristics that assign noisy labels using available features such as ratings, genres, or keywords.  \n",
    "Each LF can output:\n",
    "- `1`   → Family-friendly  \n",
    "- `0`   → Not family  \n",
    "- `-1` → Abstain (no decision)\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining many LFs, we approximate human annotation through **weak supervision**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ⚖️ Weak Label Aggregation\n",
    "LFs often disagree. We resolve their votes using a simple **majority vote** aggregator.  \n",
    "Later labs can replace this with probabilistic models (e.g., Snorkel’s LabelModel).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📈 Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "- **Coverage:** % of records labeled by any LF.  \n",
    "- **Conflict:** % of records where LFs disagree.  \n",
    "- **Overlap:** Average number of votes per record.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 **Outcome**\n",
    "By the end of this notebook you will have:\n",
    "- A cleaned Netflix dataset with parsed durations and normalized text fields.  \n",
    "- A set of Labeling Functions for family-friendly classification.  \n",
    "- A weakly labeled CSV (`netflix_labeled_family.csv`) ready for:  \n",
    "  - **Data Augmentation** (Notebook 2)  \n",
    "  - **Data Slicing & Model Development** (Notebook 3)\n",
